<h1 style="border:2px solid orange; text-align: center;">Services</h1>
  <p style = "font size=20px;">Prices differ depending on what combination of services one would like. A broad overview:</p>
  <p>The exterior is soaped down and scrubbed using a two bucket system and a non-scratch brush. This system avoids any scratches that could be caused due to the dirt already on the cars surface. The two bucket system allows the brush to be rinsed in a clean bucket of water after every dirty panel scrubbed so that the dirt is not spread across the entity of the car. Once the car is soapy, the wheels are scrubbed with another brush to remove any and all brake dust. Then the whole car is rinsed with water. While the surface is still wet, we use a mixture of soap and water to spray on the paint while rubbing it with a synthetic sponge, called a clay bar. The clay bar helps remove any small or adhered particles of dirt off the surface of the paint. After the whole car has been clay barred, it is rinsed and dried. The last step is to apply a sealant or wax to the paint, which will protect the paint for months at a time. Keeping it looking clean and shinny.</p>
<p>The interior is vacuumed and wiped in every nook and cranny imaginable. The surfaces such as the dash board, doors and cupholders and wiped with cleaning and protectant wipes. The protectant wipes help avoid discoloration to the leather or cloth from he sun. The seats are also wiped with specific chemicals depending on their material. If it is leather, then it is conditioned to rejuvenate its color and texture. The cloth is scrubbed with soap and water.</p>
