  <h1 style="border:2px solid orange;">About Us</h1>
 <p style = "font size: 30px;">The CEO of the company is Ioana R.</p>
<img src="ioana.png" alt="CEO" height="300" width="230">
  <p>She started the company five years ago with the intent of making a little extra money on the side. She was a junior in high school when the idea came to her. A training partner was complaining about how she took her car to the dealership to have it serviced and cleaned and when she got the car back, there was a giant scratch across her hood.</p>
  <p>Ioana is a car enthusiast, she has always loved cars and she has always taken very good care of her cars. By hearing her friends complaints, it hit her, the idea to start a car detailing business. The original business plan targeted an ICP (ideal customer persona) that was in their mid thirties or older that had a job and did not have time to properly clean their car. The service was set up, that Ioana would come to the clients house and detail their car(s) at their convenience. The detailing usually takes around four hours depending on the condition of the car.</p>
  <p>The projected goal in the future, is to hire two employees as well as purchase a water tank that the company can take with them to customers houses instead of using the clients water. This may also enable First Class Detailing to move the cars off the driveway to a space nearby that would have more room. Another goal would be to expand the client list in the Athens area. Ioana attended two years of college in Atlanta and created a client list of about 50 customers. However, since she has been a student at the University of Georgia in Athens, the need for the service is not as prominent and people are not willing to pay as much. First Class detailing does much more than a quick clean to your car, we bring out the new car in it.</p>
